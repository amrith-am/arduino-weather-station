Arduino Weather Station
===============
This project is designed to teach the basic skills and understanding of working with microcontrollers ATmega (Arduino). The project is a working model of an automated weather station, consisting of two the Component: transmitter and receiver. The controller transmits data to a remote web server, and to indicate the current readings uses character.

The weather station is capable of transmitting on the following environmental sotoyanii data protection:

- temperature
- humidity
- illumination
- wind speed
- wind direction
- atmosphere pressure

### Components

- Arduino Leonardo ETH
- BMP085
- DHT22
- BH1750
- PCF8574
- ML 8511

The project uses self-made developments, such as the airflow meter (angular velocity sensor based), voltmeter, light meter, as well as the switching board for Arduino PRO mini and transistor switches.
